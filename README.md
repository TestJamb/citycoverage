# Description:

I've created a robust data tooling system named the "City Coverage Rate and Acceptance Rate Dashboard" using R Flexdashboard. This tool helps address supply chain challenges by providing a comprehensive view of supply and demand, spatial visualizations, and key performance indicators (KPIs) analysis. It allows operational specialists to optimize supply spurs, and improve partner fulfillment rates, acceptance rates, and overall supply chain efficiency.

# Features:

1. View supply and demand data on any date.
2. Spatial visualization of supply and demand locations.
3. Analyze fulfillment rates, acceptance rates, and quality management.
4. Improved KPIs, including partner fulfillment rate and reduced cancellation rates.
